# To do

- [] Implement display types
  - [x] Large Icons
  - [] list type
- [] User dropdown
  - [] Log-out button, redirects to a logout page (deletes cookie / local
    storage auth) and logout page will have a "login-in" button that just
    redirects to Routehome because authentication is forced automatically
- [] Update logo colors
- [] Improve creating / editing form to include preview (maybe use modal at the bottom too?)
